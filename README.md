# WebTestFramework
Framework for displaying and interacting with test scripts for manual testing

When performing manual tests, we often resort to paper-based scripts to step through these tests and
write up the test reports. This framework aims to allow a browser-based form to be used, allowing the
tests to be generated directly from the source documents.
